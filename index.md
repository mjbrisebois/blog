My name is Matthew and I am currently working for Holochain on the
[DevHub](https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas) project.  The goal here is to document my journey
as a developer which may provide valuable research, analysis, or knowledge to other developers.  It
will also give additional insight into the context and reasoning behind development decisions that
don't belong in project documentation.
